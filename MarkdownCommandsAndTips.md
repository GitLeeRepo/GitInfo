# Tip - Internal heading links

To link internally to the **## Git remote branch commands** h2 heading enter:

* \[Remote branch commands\]\(#git-remote-branch-commands\)

Note that even though it is an h2 heading with two ##, the link only includes one #, with the space removed after it.  All subsequent spaces are replaced with hyphens, and all uppercase letters are converted to lowercase.
